# variant-functional-assay

A representation of evidence of assays of functional effect of genetic variants. This model is a work-in-progress.

This version of the model was produced using [linkml](https://linkml.io) and the [linkml-project-template](https://github.com/linkml/linkml-project-template).
The primary source file describing the model here is in `src/linkml/variant_functional_assay.yaml`, with generated artifacts (JSON-LD, OWL, SHACL, ShEx, etc)
under the `projects/` directory. 

To regenerate these artifacts, you must have [poetry](https://python-poetry.org) (e.g., using pip), then running `make` with one of the relevant targets.

Rendered documentation is available at [https://clingen-data-model.github.io/variant-functional-assay/](https://clingen-data-model.github.io/variant-functional-assay/).
