# Slot: patient derived material used


Material used as inputs or comparators within an assay that were derived/sourced from a patient. These are differentiated from other materials used in an assay because of the possibility that use of such materials may involved confounding variables (e.g.,  other genetic variants) that may be difficult to account for in validation. CLO, CO and BAI terms are preferred when available.
